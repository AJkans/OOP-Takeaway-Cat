# Exception Handling in Java

## Description
This Java program demonstrates **exception handling** by handling division errors.  
- The program takes two numbers as input and divides the first by the second.  
- It catches the `ArithmeticException` if the second number is zero and displays a meaningful message.  

## Features
- Accepts two numbers from the user.  
- Performs division with error handling.  
- Catches `ArithmeticException` when dividing by zero.  
- Displays `"Cannot divide by zero!"` when an error occurs.  

## Usage
1. Save the code as `DivisionCalculator.java`.  
2. Compile the program:  
   ```sh
   javac DivisionCalculator.java
