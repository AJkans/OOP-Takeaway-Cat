# Abstraction in Java

## Description
This Java program demonstrates **abstraction** using an abstract class `Appliance` and its subclasses `Fan` and `TV`.  
- The `Appliance` class defines an abstract method `turnOn()`.  
- The `Fan` and `TV` classes provide their own implementations of `turnOn()`.  

## Features
- Defines an abstract class `Appliance` with an abstract method `turnOn()`.
- Implements `turnOn()` in two subclasses: `Fan` and `TV`.
- Demonstrates abstraction by creating objects and calling `turnOn()`.

## Usage
1. Save the code as `Main.java`.
2. Compile the program:
   ```sh
   javac Main.java
